The mockups depict the layout web app in mobile, desktop, and tablet, with 3 pages for each mockup. The first page of each group indicates what occurs when the name input button is clicked, the second indicates what the page will look like after the name is inputed, and the third indicates what the page will look like when the feed me button is pressed. The play with me, heal me, and clean me buttons work the same as the feed me button just instead changing the happiness, health, and cleanliness metric respectively. (The cleanliness button also results in a slight change in the health metric).
